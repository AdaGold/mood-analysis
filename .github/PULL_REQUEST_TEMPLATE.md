## Comprehension Questions



|  Question 	|  Answer 	|
|---	|---	|
|  Why does 03/13 come out as neutral when it should be happy? How could we fix this?	|   	|
|  Where should we call strip_punctuation? Does it matter? Why?	|   	|
|  What are you going to do if there aren't at least 3 happy days? Where do you need to handle that case? 	|   	|
|  In the `overall_mood` function would it make more sense to use an Array or a Hash to determine the most common mood? Why? 	|   	|
|  What if we eventually want to add feelings to our analysis? For example if we wanted to add 'angry' or 'excited' to the list of feelings in the analysis? Can we write this code in a way that will prevent us from having to re-write it later?   	|
